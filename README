## Supported Commands

### Commands in Support but need revisit ideas on design

#### Word Count: `store wc`

Returns the total number of words in all files stored in the server.

#### Example:

#### Frequent Words: `store freq-words [--limit|-n 10] [--order=dsc|asc]`

Returns the most or least frequent words in all files stored in the server.

##### Options:

- `--limit | -n <number>`: Limits the number of results (default: 10).
- `--order <asc|dsc>`: Sorts the result in ascending or descending order (default: `dsc`).

##### Server Response:

## Tradeoffs & Performance TODO Revisit

- **Word Count**: The current implementation reads each file sequentially and counts words. This could be slow for large files, but we optimized it using parallel processing.
- **Frequent Words**: Sorting by frequency is handled by the server. For large datasets, this could be memory-intensive, and future enhancements may include using a database or distributed file system.
